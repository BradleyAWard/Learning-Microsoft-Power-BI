## 1) Intro to Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is a data analytics and visualization tool powerful enough for the most demanding data scientists but accessible enough for everyday use by anyone needing to get more from their data. This chapter introduces Microsoft Power BI, discusses the entire Power BI family of products, provides an overview of how Power BI works, and looks at what distinguishes it from other similar tools.

### What is Power BI?

Power BI is both a piece of software and a larger ecosystem of products. Usually when people use the term "Power BI", it is in reference to the desktop software. However, when discussing how most people will visually share their work with others, it is done in the context of the Power BI service. Hereafter, we focus on Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service. *Power BI Desktop* is a tool for data investigation and visualization. Analysts can take data and create interactive reports that enable end users to garner insights.

The following is an overview of the components of the Power BI family of products:

- *Power BI Desktop*

A free application you install on a local computer that you can use to connect to, transform and visualize data.

- *Power BI service*

An online software-as-a-service solution that lets end users share reports created in Power BI Desktop or Power BI Report Builder with users across an organization.
